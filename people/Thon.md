> **MOTIVATION**

I'm a self-motivated future Software Engineer at iTalanta Academy. What
motivated me reflect back to Father of Artificial Intelligence John McCarthy
theory of artificial intelligence.

Artificial Intelligence is a way of making a computer, a computer-controlled
robot, or a software think intelligently, in the similar manner the intelligent
humans think.

John McCarthy not only based on AI discovery but also made tremendous moves on
contribution of Technology to Science and how it could improves simple life.

> **EXPERIENCES**

Beside my profession, I have been working as an Information Communication
Technology Coach through Digital Literacy program implemented by UNHCR under

In nutshell, all this impacted me with strong and meaningful implications of
Technology, ranging from advantageous impact to demerit part of it.
